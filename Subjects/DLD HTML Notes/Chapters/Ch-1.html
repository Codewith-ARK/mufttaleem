    </div>
    <h3>Number Systems:</h3>
    <p>There are four types of number systems one decimalnumber system two binary number system 3 octal number system 4 hexadecimal number system decimal number system decimal number system have 10 symbols from zero to 9 to represent the system the system is a weighted system are given by the (10<sup>n</sup> - 10<sup>-n</sup>). This number system is used by Humans.</p>

    <h3>Binary Number Systems:</h3>
    <p>The binary number system has base two means two symbols zero and one 
        are used to represent this system this number system is also a weighted system 
        the weights of binary number system are given by 2<sup>n</sup> – 2<sup>-n</sup>. The computer system uses binary number system</p>

    <h3>Octal Number System:</h3>
    <p>This system has a base 8 means eight symbols from zero to 7 are used to represent this system like decimal and binary, the octal number system is also rated system the weights of octal number system are given by 8<sup>n</sup> - 8<sup>-n</sup>. The advantage of this number system is that each octal digit represent 3 binary digit.</p>

    <h3>Hexa-Decimal Number System</h3>
    <p>This number system has a 16 base means 16 symbols are used to represent this system out of these six symbols turn our decimal digits from zero to 9 and six are alphabet from A to F (10 – 15). The main advantage of this system is that each hexadecimal digit represent four binary bits.</p>

    <h3>Table of Number System:</h3>
