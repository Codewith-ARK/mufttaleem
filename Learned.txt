display
NOTE: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is.
    (display: <property>)

    1. block: A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
    2. inline: An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
    3. none: is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them.
